# Number Classification API

## Overview
This is a simple Number Classification API built to classify numbers into categories: Odd or Even. The API is deployed as an AWS Lambda function, which can be invoked to determine whether a given number is odd or even.

## Features
- **Number Classification**: The API accepts a number and returns whether it is Odd or Even.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Deployed using AWS Lambda for efficient serverless operation.
- **API Gateway Integration**: Exposed through API Gateway for easy HTTP access.
- ***Input Validation:** Ensures the provided input is a valid integer.
Mathematical Analysis:
Prime Check: Determines if the number is prime.
Perfect Number Check: Checks if the number is a perfect number.
Armstrong Check: Determines if the number is an Armstrong (narcissistic) number.
Digit Sum: Calculates the sum of the digits.
Properties List: Returns a list indicating if the number is:
An Armstrong number along with its parity (e.g., ["armstrong", "odd"] or ["armstrong", "even"])
Or simply its parity (e.g., ["odd"] or ["even"]) if itâ€™s not an Armstrong number.
Fun Fact: Retrieves a fun fact about the number from the Numbers API using its math endpoint.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:
- **AWS CLI**: For managing AWS resources.
- **Python 3.x**: The language used for the Lambda function.
- **AWS Lambda Console / AWS SAM**: For deploying the function.
- **API Gateway**: To expose the function via HTTP requests.

### Installation
- request
  pip install requests -t .

After the installation, file was zip and uploaded to lambda, where it was deployed and tested.

### API GATEWAY CREATION
API was created and integrated with Lambda function that was created and http.
